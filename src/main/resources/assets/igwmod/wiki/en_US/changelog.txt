* Advanced Solar Panels

** Fixed helmet recipes.


** Big Reactors

* Reactor Casing now requires steel plates x6 graphitex2 uraniumingotx1
* Turbine Housing now requires Steel Plates x6 graphitex2 CyaniteIngotx1
* Changed Fuel rod recipe.
* desynced yellowrite from uranium Ore dic. (when uranium is more common than tin there is issues)
* desynced Blutonium from plutonium ore dic. (wtf op?)
* Decreased power production multiplier to 0.4 from 0.8
* Increased Fuel Usage Multiplier to 5.0 from 1.5 
** Reasoning Currently a 5x5 can produce 4 million MB (4000 buckets) of steam with the cost of around 2 uranium which can be converted to EU. While on the IC2 side the reactor can use a fuel rod (6 ingots) and can safley produce the same EU.
